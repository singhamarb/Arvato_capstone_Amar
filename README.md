### Dataset And Inputs
Four main steps as detailed below:
In this project we are provided with 4 datasets in total.
**AZDIAS:** Demographics data for the general population of Germany.<br>
**CUSTOMERS:** Demographics data for customers of a mail-order company.<br>
**MAILOUT_TRAIN & MAILOUT_TEST**: Demographics data for individuals who were targets of a marketing campaign.<br>

In addition to the above data, there are two additional meta-data:<br>
· **DIAS Information Levels** - Attributes 2017.xlsx: a top-level list of attributes and descriptions, organized by informational category<br>
· **DIAS Attributes** - Values 2017.xlsx: a detailed mapping of data values for each feature in alphabetical order<br>

### Project Motivation:
The project has three major steps: the customer segmentation report, the supervised learning model, and the Kaggle Competition.<br>

**1. Customer Segmentation Report**
This section will be similar to the corresponding project in Term 1 of the program, but the datasets now include more features that you can potentially use. You'll begin the project by using unsupervised learning methods to analyze attributes of established customers and the general population in order to create customer segments.

**2. Supervised Learning Model**
You'll have access to a third dataset with attributes from targets of a mail order campaign. You'll use the previous analysis to build a machine learning model that predicts whether or not each individual will respond to the campaign.

**3. Kaggle Competition**
Once you've chosen a model, you'll use it to make predictions on the campaign data as part of a Kaggle Competition. You'll rank the individuals by how likely they are to convert to being a customer, and see how your modeling skills measure up against your fellow students.

### Instructions
As stated above the data for this project is not publicly available. For this reason the notebook and models provided by this repository cannot be used, but are made available to serve as a snapshot of the state of the project at the end
