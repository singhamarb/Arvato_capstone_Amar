### Introduction:
The project has three major steps: the customer segmentation report, the supervised learning model, and the Kaggle Competition.<br>

**1. Customer Segmentation Report**
This section will be similar to the corresponding project in Term 1 of the program, but the datasets now include more features that you can potentially use. You'll begin the project by using unsupervised learning methods to analyze attributes of established customers and the general population in order to create customer segments.

**2. Supervised Learning Model**
You'll have access to a third dataset with attributes from targets of a mail order campaign. You'll use the previous analysis to build a machine learning model that predicts whether or not each individual will respond to the campaign.

**3. Kaggle Competition**
Once you've chosen a model, you'll use it to make predictions on the campaign data as part of a Kaggle Competition. You'll rank the individuals by how likely they are to convert to being a customer, and see how your modeling skills measure up against your fellow students.

### Data:
Four data sets are there in this project.
**AZDIAS**<br>
**CUSTOMERS:** <br>
**MAILOUT_TRAIN & MAILOUT_TEST**<br>
**DIAS Information Levels** -<br>
**DIAS Attributes** <br>

 ### Project Motivation:
 In this project, we will analyze demographics data for customers of a mail-order sales company in Germany, comparing it against demographics information for the general population. You'll use unsupervised learning techniques to perform customer segmentation, identifying the parts of the population that best describe the core customer base of the company. Then, we'll apply what we've learned on a third dataset with demographics information for targets of a marketing campaign for the company, and use a model to predict which individuals are most likely to convert into becoming customers for the company

**3. Kaggle Competition**
Once you've chosen a model, you'll use it to make predictions on the campaign data as part of a Kaggle Competition. You'll rank the individuals by how likely they are to convert to being a customer, and see how your modeling skills measure up against your fellow students.
