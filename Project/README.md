### Introduction:
The project has three major steps: the customer segmentation report, the supervised learning model, and the Kaggle Competition.<br>

**1. Customer Segmentation Report**
This section will be similar to the corresponding project in Term 1 of the program, but the datasets now include more features that you can potentially use. You'll begin the project by using unsupervised learning methods to analyze attributes of established customers and the general population in order to create customer segments.

**2. Supervised Learning Model**
You'll have access to a third dataset with attributes from targets of a mail order campaign. You'll use the previous analysis to build a machine learning model that predicts whether or not each individual will respond to the campaign.

**3. Kaggle Competition**
Once you've chosen a model, you'll use it to make predictions on the campaign data as part of a Kaggle Competition. You'll rank the individuals by how likely they are to convert to being a customer, and see how your modeling skills measure up against your fellow students.

### Data:
Four data sets are there in this project.
**AZDIAS**<br>
**CUSTOMERS:** <br>
**MAILOUT_TRAIN & MAILOUT_TEST**<br>
**DIAS Information Levels** -<br>
**DIAS Attributes** <br>

 ### Project Motivation:
Nowdays every company wants to target customers which will buy or use their service and invest money accordingly in campaign so we have done something similarly in this project for Arvato company .This capstone project is about the machine learning technique used to identify customer segment to which the mail must be sent in order to get maximum probablity of customer getting turned towards company mail.<br> Following steps are done in this project: <br>• Data Exploration and Cleaning.<br> • Data Vizualization.<br> • Data Preprocessing.<br> • Supervised Learning -model selection <br>• Model Evaluation and validation. <br>• Model testing/Kagle Competition.
